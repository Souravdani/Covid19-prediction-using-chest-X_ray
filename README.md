# Covid19-prediction-using-chest-X_ray
Using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for predicting if a patient is affected with covid 19.
There was a need for rapid evaluation of the covid test results
Blood test are costly takes large time to do test.
If we can test X-ray, we can also find the extent of the disease severety.
We can do classification based on the image classification and segmentation techniques.
We are using a CNN based model.
We have a date of positive covid samples (chest X-ray) which was being recorded by a group of docters on github which have 142 positive covid samples.
We also need negative samples, so we have a popular dataset on kaggle that is ches xray dataset.
Chest X-ray dataset gives the images in three category i.e. Normal, Bacterial pnemonia, Viral pnemonia.
